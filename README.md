# Grandmother's Memorial Website

A loving tribute preserving family stories and memories through beautifully designed letter-style pages.

## About This Project

This website is a memorial to preserve interview responses and stories from my grandmother. Each story is presented as a handwritten letter with a vintage aesthetic, complemented by historical research and contextual links to places, events, and cultural touchstones mentioned in her memories.

## Features

- **8 Story Pages**: Each interview question and response presented as an individual letter
- **Vintage Aesthetic**: Warm, nostalgic design with cream and sepia tones, paper textures, and elegant typography
- **Historical Context**: Curated research links, archival photos, museum collections, and historical articles related to each story
- **Responsive Design**: Works beautifully on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
